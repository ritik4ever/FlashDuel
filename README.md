#  FlashDuel — 1v1 Crypto Trading Battles

**ETHGlobal 2025 | Powered by Yellow Network**

FlashDuel is a fast, skill‑based **1v1 crypto trading game**. Two players stake the same USDC, trade real market prices for a few minutes, and the **better trader wins the pot**.

No gas during gameplay. Trades are instant. Settlement is trustless.

## What is FlashDuel?

* Create or join a 1v1 match
* Both players stake **equal USDC**
* Trade **ETH / BTC / SOL** at live prices
* When the timer ends, **higher portfolio value wins**
* **Winner takes 95%**, platform fee **5%**

Wallet address = player identity. No profiles needed for MVP.



##  Why It’s Different

* **Instant trades** (real‑time updates)
* **Zero gas while trading**
* **On‑chain escrow** for stakes
* **Pure skill** — same starting balance for both players
* **Powered by Yellow Network Nitrolite SDK** for state‑channel based off‑chain execution

##  Game Flow (Simple)

1. Player A creates a match (stakes USDC)

3. 5‑minute trading battle starts
4. Both trade ETH / BTC / SOL at live prices
5. Timer ends → portfolio values compared
6. Winner receives 95% of the pool
